# chessFish
This is an implementation of the chess game (in progres) to use in a chess engine.
The implementation use's cpp and bitboards to make the move generation faster and so give the engine more time to think about the moves in its algorithm.

# future plans
I want to test a lot of aproaches for the move selection when the basic chess is finished.
  - random move selection
  - minimax move selection
      - with alpha beta branch pruning
      - with move ordening
      - with killer moves ?
  - (machine learning aproach ?)
I also want a interface where i can choose and visualize bitboards and play moves.
It would be handy to have a interface where i can let 2 versions of the engine play each other.
